1. Name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works.

The “Random Forest” estimation technique. This technique is a semi-automated dasymetric method that generates a gridded prediction of population density at ~100m spatial resolution by combining a weighting scheme, which is based on the Random Forest predictive model, and combining it with population counts from census data. 

2. What is a machine learning algorithm? What distinguishes a machine learning method such as Random Forest from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomena and events?

A machine learning algorithm is something that allows a computer system to use patterns to perform tasks without explicit instructions. An advantage of the Random Forest method is that it uses finer-level administrative units in its algorithms to increase its ability to predict population density at smaller scales. In addition, it improves upon other methods by incorporating data sets other than just land cover and climate zones, such as distance to health facilities, schools, and roads.

3. What were the geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distribution?

Geospatial covariates used include night-lights, topography, land cover, climate zones, and distances to health facilities, schools, roads, and other features that are likely good predictors of population. Each covariate represented between approximately 30 - 300m. Big data is vital in the estimation of machine learning methods because it allows for higher accuracy patterns and inferences to be created.

4. What is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet Earth (within context of human development in LMICs)?

In general, having a highly accurate description of where each person is located allows for better resource allocation and response ability in times of crisis, and higher accuracy for political representation. With an estimated population increase of 2.3 billion people between 2011 and 2050, it's necessary that our limited resources (especially limited in LMICs) are used as efficiently and effectively as possible. 

5. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation of having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

Jamaica is one of the most at-risk counties on the planet in terms of natural disasters, such as floods, landslides, hurricanes, droughts, and earthquakes. In all of these situations, it is of utmost importance for the government and any aid organizations to know exactly where every single person lives. For this reason, Random Forest, which creates a highly accurate description of where each household is located, is extremely useful.
