Geospatial datasets represent a range of metrics relevant to global human population mapping at fine spatial scales. In Lloyd’s paper, four main raster geospatial datasets are referenced as to form the basis of WorldPop: topography, country identification, country area, and slope layer. When “stacked” together, these datasets are a major improvement over a conventional census. For example, rather than displaying an even distribution of population, this method disaggregates the typical census units and displays a more accurate proportional distribution of the population in the grid cells (if we were to see a mountain in one half of the grid cell, it is likely that the population in concentrated in the other half). In addition, the author describes how WorldPop uses this methodology at 30 arc-seconds (1km at the equator) to create much more detailed images. 

Higher resolution images and more accurate representations of population distribution can be incredibly useful. For example, these spatial datasets have found use in resource allocation, disaster management, transport and city planning, and poverty mapping, among other things.
