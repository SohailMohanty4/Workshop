Question: Nieves et al. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

Nieves et al. used the random forest machine learning method to predict population density in LMICs. Random forest, a type of 
machine-learning falling under the category “ensemble methods,” works by taking individual decision trees that are considered 
“weak learners,” and combining them to form a “strong learner.” Benefits of ensemble methods include increased 
generalizability,improved performance on large or small datasets, and the ability to model difficult learning tasks is more 
effective. Compared with other ensemble methods, random forests are robust to noise, small sample sizes, and over-fitting, yet 
they need little in the way of parameter specifications - it’s machine learning ability allows it to learn how to do this on 
its own.

Dasymetric population allocation is done by dividing land up into sections or zones of relatively homogenous land type, and 
using each of these areas to individually predict population, and then combining these estimates to get a full idea of the 
population density of the given region or county. 

When predicting global values of where humans reside, Nieves et al. found that the covariate pertaining to urban areas and 
topographical features were the most important predictors of population density at all scales of analysis.
